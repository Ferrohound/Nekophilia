This is it. I'm sure of it.

@tAimee
Really? I thought it was the OTHER
creepy abandoned house in the
middle of the woods.

@tOwen
This is exactly how I pictured it.
Oscuro always loved Victorians.
Though I had him pinned for a Dark
Blue or Maroon exterior finish
type of guy.

@tAimee
-Sigh-

Can we just get inside please?
You get your dumb painting,
I get my money, and I can go
about my life not having to hear
you swoon over this painter dude.

@tOwen
Painter dude? Javier Oscuro is a
legend. Or was. No one really knows
where he is now. And this "dumb
painting", as I keep telling you,
is the last one he worked on.

It'd be worth @0millions.

@tAimee
You're finally holding my interest.
Let's get inside.
