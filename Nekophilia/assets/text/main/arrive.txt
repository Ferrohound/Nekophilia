This is it. I'm sure of it.

@:Aimee
Really? I thought it was the OTHER
creepy abandoned house in the
middle of the woods.

@:Owen
This is exactly how I pictured it.
Oscuro always loved Victorians.

Though I had him pinned for a Dark
Blue or Maroon exterior finish
type of guy.

@:Aimee
-Sigh-@\                     
Can we just get inside please?

You get your dumb painting, I get
my money, and I can go about my
life not having to hear you swoon
over this painter dude.

@:Owen
Painter dude? Javier Oscuro is a
legend.
Or was.
No one really knows where he is now.

Also, this 'dumb painting', as
I've told you multiple times,
would be the last one he worked on.
It'd be worth millions.

@:Aimee
Whatever...
You've got a light right?

@:Owen
Of course. My trusty lantern my
grandfather gave to me. He said,
'O, it's dangerous to go alone,
take this!'

@:Aimee
...Yeah, whatever.
One last thing... Was the dress
REALLY necessary? I feel like a
plastic doll in this. 

@:Owen
Absolutely. We need to sell the
illusion. Or would you prefer to
be wearing a ski mask and a
black and white striped shirt?

@:Aimee
Illusion? For who, The trees??

@:Owen
... Let's get inside!
