Yeah, I'm getting the hell out

@:Owen
We're already close. We just have

@:Aimee
Are you out of your freaking mind?

@:Owen
Look, it's not like there's a red
exit sign anywhere nearby. We might

@:Owen
You're scared of the dark?
Well now, that's quite amusing.

@:Aimee
Oh, we are NOT having this discussion.
