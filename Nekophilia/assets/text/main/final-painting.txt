Is this it?

@:Owen
Yes. But... It...

@:Aimee
What? It what?

@:Owen
It's ruined.

@:Aimee
What??

@:Owen
It's been scribbled all over...
but it's in Oscuro's handwriting.

@:Aimee
And??

@:Owen
"Los salvajes... mis tesoros...
Han salido de mis sueños y ahora
me torturan dur
@x@:Aimee
Thanks Señor, take the sombrero
off and run that by me in English
please.

@:Owen
Oscuro was Bolivian, not Mexican.

@:Aimee
Oh my god, I don't care.

@:Owen
He says the animals that tortured
his dreams now haunt him in reality.
He knew 'they' were coming for him.

He talked about surrendering to the
'wave of death'. Oscuro's Osiris
isn't a only a painting...
it's his epitaph.

@:Aimee
Wave of death...
That sounds familiar.

@:Owen
...Let's get out of here.

@:Aimee
What?
After all that?
Without the painting?

@:Owen
Something is alive in this house.
It's living and breathing in every
corner. I don't feel like tempting
any more than we already have,
do you?

@:Aimee
-Sigh-

After you.
