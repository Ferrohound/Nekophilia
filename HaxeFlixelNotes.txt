FlxG global -> has mouse.screenX(screen/camera position), or mouse.x(world position)
	sound/music -> sound.play/sound.playMusic
FlxState level
FlxTilemap mhm
...Sprite
...Group - group collections of sprites together, parallax~~
	//kill if you don't want the object to become null
...Tween 
...Text - gui, dialogue, soup that shit up, setFormat()
...Button - loadGraphic(...)

FlxG.overlap(obj1, obj2, callbackfunction);
//collide: if they're touching, keep them separated
FlxG.collide(obj1, obj2, callback);

{
	var x;
	var structure = {x:12, name:"test"};
	
	var a = [for (i in 0...10) i];
	//array 0-9
	
	enums?

}

if
else if
else

uses switch
break doesn't work with switch, however

uses hash tables
var map1:Map<Int, String>
OR
var map2 = [
	"test" => 1,
	"test2" => 2
];

//classes only have one parent class, but can implement multiple interfaces
//extends for parents, implements for interfaces
//overriding methods; override function foo() : Int { return super.foo() +1 }
//can still access the super class
class TMP{
	var x : Int;
	var y : Int;
	
	//constructor, use new
	public function new(){
		this.x = bla;
		this.y = bla;
	}

}
